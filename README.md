Project for the course 'Gestión de proyectos informáticos' (IT project management) in the Universitat Politécnica de Valéncia.

#Scope
This project aims to develop a GUI application able to manage the activities, resoureces and work time of any business project. Said project is built to substitute non-friendly tools such as CA SuperProject, these tools are neither easy to be used when creating new projects nor for report analysis. Thus, our application is a complete tool easy to manage for any skilled or non-skilled user.
